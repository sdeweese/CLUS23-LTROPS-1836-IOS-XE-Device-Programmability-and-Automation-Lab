## **Module: gNOI reset.proto "factory reset" API**

## Version: Cisco IOS XE 17.11

![](imgs/device_lifecycle.png)

## Factory Reset API

Reset.proto also known as the Factory Reset API is the latest addition to the gNOI operations interface within the gNMI.

The factory reset API as described at [openconfig/gnoi](https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/tree/master/factory_reset) with tooling from [google/gnxi](https://github.com/google/gnxi/tree/master/gnoi_reset).

This module describes the capabilities of the gnoi_reset tooling which is used to factory reset Cisco Catalyst IOS XE devices like the Catalyst 9300 used in this example.

The console port is use to watch as the device completes the factory reset and reboots.

## Zero Touch Provisioning
As part of the Day 0 workflows, the ZTP process will be used to automatically configure the C9300 switch back to a configured state where the API's are ready for use once again. Once Factory reset is complete, we can use ZTP to add the necessary configurations to our device using NETCONF. To skip directly to learn more about ZTP, jump [here](ZTP.md).

# Enable the gNMI API Interface

In this example the gNMI API interface is enabled with the most basic and minimal configuration. 

c9300-pod28# ***show run | i gnxi***

We should see the following in the response from the show command:

gnxi

gnxi server


# Verify gNMI API Interface

There are two show CLI's to help understand the state and status of gNMI and the gNOI microservices

**show gnxi state**

and

**show gnxi state detail**

Output from each of these is seen below showing that the gNMI is State Enabled and Status Up, and that the three gNOI services are each Enabled/Up/Supported


```
c9300-pod29#show gnxi state

# gnoi_reset tooling

As with previous gNOI examples the tooling from [Github.com/google/gnxi](Github.com/google/gnxi) is used to work with the API. The provided gnoi_reset tooling enables testing and validation of the gNOI reset.proto APIs.

The tooling is installed using the **go get** and **go build** commands within the Linux environment. 

The following commands to get have already been done for you to set up gNOI.reset on the Linux VM:

```
go get github.com/google/gnxi/gnoi_reset
go install github.com/google/gnxi/gnoi_reset
```

# gnoi_reset and zero_fill

gNOI_reset clears all of the configurations on the disk of the Catatlyst 9000 and resets the device back to factory settings.

The **gnoi_reset** tooling can be called with some options to specify the target address, target name, TLS options, and the use of the zero_fill option.

Zero Fill is the process that instructs the target device to zero fill the persistent storage state data. All sectors on the disk are overwritten with zero's so data is found after the operation. 

On the Linux VM, run the following command to reset all of the configurations and disk back to factory settings:

`/home/auto/gnoi_reset -target_addr 10.1.1.5:9339 -target_name c9300 -zero_fill -cert ./client.crt -ca ./rootCA.pem  -key ./rootCA.key  -insecure
`

A message similar to this should appear: 
***I1014 11:53:15.248633 2761247 gnoi_reset.go:59] Reset Called Successfully!***


It will take the switch about 5 minutes to reload. To see an example of what that will look like, see the output below. In the meantime, review how to set up and use [ZTP](ZTP.md). Once the switch comes back up, we will automatically apply the changes in ZTP.

When the gnoi_reset factor reset operation is called then the device will go down for factory reset. The follow is displayed onto the serial console of the device which captures the log messages and shows the progress as the device is zero_filled and reset.

Enter the serial console on the Linux VM using the following: `console-helper`




NOTE: the following output is simply shown for reference

# Conclusion

The gNOI Factory Reset API, or reset.proto, can be used to easily factory reset IOS XE devices with a single API call.
